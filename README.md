Advent of Code 2022!
====================

In this project, I'll be using [Pants Build](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) to solve the tasks,
implemented in Python using Pants `@rule`s and the [underpants](https://github.com/kaos/underpants)
library to do so.


To run the first days task:

    ╰─❯ ./pants run day-01
    It is Elf #134 that is carrying the most calories, of 71924 cals.
    And of the 3 Elves carrying the most, the total number of calories carried is 210406 cals.

This is with my inputs, of course. If you want to try it with something else, pass another input file.
